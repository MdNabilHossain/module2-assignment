                <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
                    incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others,
                    establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and
                    nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this
                    social order until a new pecking order is established.</p>
